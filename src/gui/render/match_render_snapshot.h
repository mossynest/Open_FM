/**
 * Read-only normalized world state consumed by renderers.
 *
 * This header does not include the engine: renderers see only the snapshot,
 * and the engine is read in match_render_snapshot.cpp.
 *
 * The snapshot is rebuilt every frame from a `MatchEngine` and carries the
 * previous and current fixed-step positions plus the interpolation fraction,
 * so 2D and 3D renderers can interpolate without touching the
 * simulation. Renderers must never mutate this data or the engine.
 *
 * Positions are copied, but Player pointers and the event/statistics pointers
 * in MatchRenderSnapshot remain borrowed. Consume the snapshot while its
 * source engine and players are alive and stable; it is not an owned replay
 * record or a cross-thread publication format. See
 * docs/development/match-engine.md.
 *
 * Units: positions are normalised pitch coordinates (x along the 105 m
 * length, home attacking +x; y across the 68 m width). Ball `currentZ` and
 * `previousZ` are in length units (metres = z * 105); the `*HeightMetres`
 * fields carry the same value already converted to metres.
