/**
 * True view (Notes and plans/match_engine_true_view_plan.md): one player in
 * 3D as the Binturong body models him, with no human figure on top. The
 * body cylinder, the lines between feet, thigh, chest and head, each
 * part's reach with its comfort gap, dead zone and stretch (rings of 12
 * sections), each technique's own range, jumping, falling and getting up,
 * and the personal space the brain keeps. Every shape is read from the
 * engine's functions and the sandbox's tuning (the contact view's knobs).
