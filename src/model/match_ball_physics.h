/**
 * The match's "ball physics": how the ball moves on its own once struck -
 * flight under gravity and air drag, bounces, rolling, the swerve of spin -
 * and the launch solvers that turn "reach there at this speed or height"
 * into a kick, worked out with the same physics so predicted and real
 * flights match. Contacts with players (kicks, touches, saves, rebounds) and
 * what the ball's position means (goals, out of play) are shared by every
 * ball. Brains and bodies predict flights through MatchEngine::stepFlight,
 * so they always use the match's own physics.
 *
 * AARDVARK is the inherited physics, kept frozen for comparison; the
 * BINTURONG and later ones are the ones being developed. One per match,
 * chosen before kickoff (MatchEngine::setBallPhysics).
