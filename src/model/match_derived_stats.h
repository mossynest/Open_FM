// The match engine's stats come in three layers:
//
// 1. CURRENT stats: what the game and its database carry today (the nine in
//    stats_config.json, plus height). The handshake loads them; here they
//    are the BaseAttribute a recipe blends.
// 2. FUTURE game stats (DerivedLayer::FUTURE_GAME_STAT): stats the game is
//    meant to carry one day as stats of their own (shown, trained, stored).
//    Until it does, each is derived here from current stats by a recipe
//    (and, for a stat built on his body, his height).
//    When the game carries one, the handshake loads it in place of its
//    recipe, and nothing downstream changes: the engine reads the same
//    slot.
// 3. MATCH-ENGINE-ONLY stats (DerivedLayer::MATCH_ENGINE_ONLY): physiology
//    and other inner workings with no place in the game. They exist only
//    during a match, derived from current and future stats (never from
//    each other), so they keep working unchanged when a future stat starts
//    coming from the game.
//
// Some match-engine-only values are not stats here but physical values the
// handshake works out directly (top speed from Pace, braking from
// Physicality).
//
// A derived stat is a rating on the 0-1 scale; what it means physically is
// up to whoever uses it, with anchors here for the stats that have a
// natural unit. Future stats come first in DerivedStat, so deriving in
// order has every future stat ready before a match-engine-only recipe reads
// it.
//
// To add a stat: an id in DerivedStat (in its layer's block), a row in
// DERIVED_STATS, a recipe in DEFAULT_DERIVED_RECIPES (and in any handshake
// with its own recipes), then use it. The sandbox inspector, the --check
// test and fm_lab read this registry, so they need nothing more; --check
// enforces the layers.
