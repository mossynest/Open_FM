/**
 * Observation hooks of the match engine for debugging tools (the match
 * sandbox). See MatchEngine::setRecorder.
 *
 * The engine calls a recorder only when one is attached, and only to report
 * what it has already decided: a recorder must never change the engine, so a
 * recorded match plays exactly like an unrecorded one. Everything the engine
 * exposes through its getters (phases, intents, targets, keeper states, the
 * ball, events, substitutions) is read by the recorder in onStepEnd(); these
 * records carry what the getters cannot show (rankings, scores, actions).
 *
 * Copies of an engine (highlight look-ahead, saved states) never carry the
 * recorder, so predictions are never recorded.
