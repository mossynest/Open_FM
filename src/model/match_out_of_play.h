/**
 * The match's "out of play": what happens when the ball leaves play and how
 * play restarts - a goal (and who scored it), the woodwork, a corner, goal
 * kick or throw-in, the ball settling in the net, and every restart set up
 * and released (throw-ins, goal kicks, corners, free kicks, penalties, the
 * taker placed). Who takes a restart, where everyone stands for it and what
 * the taker does with the ball are the brains' (match_brain.h); how he
 * strikes it, a direct free kick against the wall included, is his body's
 * (match_body.h); the kick-off is shared.
 *
 * AARDVARK is the inherited version, kept frozen for comparison; BINTURONG
 * and later ones are the ones being developed. One per match, chosen before
 * kickoff (MatchEngine::setOutOfPlay).
